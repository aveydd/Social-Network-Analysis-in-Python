# Social-Network-Analysis-in-Python
Networks today are part of our everyday life. Let's see how to visualize and understand a social network in Python using Networks. If you want to learn about Network Analysis,  Networks are everywhere, networks of roads, a network of friends and followers on social media, and a network of office colleagues. They are playing a significant role in our day to day lives from spreading useful information to influencing national elections. The ability to analyze these networks and make informed decisions based on them is a skill that is important for any data analyst.  The focus of this tutorial is to teach social network analysis (SNA) using Python and NetworkX, a Python library for the study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. This tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic syntax of Python, no previous knowledge of SNA is expected.
